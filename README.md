## Title :
ML-Driven IPL Live Match Oracle.

## Project Summary:

Deployed a cutting-edge predictive model that learns from historical data patterns.Continuously updating input features with new match data recalculates win probabilities.

## Technology used:

Scikit-learn, LogisticRegression, RandomForest, ML-Pipeline, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Lambda fun,ColumnTransformer, OneHotEncoder.

The project utilizes various technologies to accomplish its tasks effectively:


1. **Data Collection**: The project begins with the collection of historical IPL match data from reliable sources. This data typically includes match details such as teams involved, venue, innings, runs scored, wickets taken, and more.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Once the data is collected, it undergoes preprocessing to ensure quality and consistency. This involves tasks such as handling missing values, cleaning data anomalies, standardizing team names, and merging relevant datasets.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Feature engineering is a crucial step where meaningful features are derived from the raw data. Features like current run rate (CRR), required run rate (RRR), total runs scored, and wickets taken are computed to capture match dynamics effectively.

4. **Model Selection**: After feature engineering, suitable machine learning algorithms are chosen for the predictive model. In this project, logistic regression and random forest classifiers are utilized due to their effectiveness in classification tasks.

5. **Model Training**: The selected machine learning models are trained on the preprocessed data. During training, the models learn from historical patterns in the data to make predictions about match outcomes.

6. **Parameter Tuning**: To optimize model performance, parameters of the machine learning algorithms are fine-tuned. Techniques such as grid search or random search are commonly used to identify the best combination of parameters.

7. **Model Evaluation**: Once trained, the models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step ensures that the models generalize well to unseen data and make reliable predictions.

8. **Real-time Prediction**: In live match scenarios, the trained models are deployed to make real-time predictions. As new match data becomes available (e.g., updated scores, wickets, overs), the models continuously update their predictions, recalculating win probabilities and match outcomes on the fly.

9. **Visualization and Reporting**: Finally, the project may include visualization techniques to present predictions and insights in an intuitive manner. Visualizations such as graphs, charts, and dashboards help stakeholders understand the match dynamics and make informed decisions.

By following these steps, the project effectively harnesses historical IPL match data to build a predictive model that accurately forecasts match outcomes in real-time, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in the cricketing domain.
